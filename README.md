PiHPSDR Controller v2 based on LA2NI design

This design is un-abashedly copied from LA2NI's Controller2 design.

It is SIMPLIFIED in that it doesn't have an power supplies or On/Off buttons.  It takes 5V power
and sends it to the Raspberry Pi mounted on the controller.

The design uses the classic 7 inch Raspberry Pi LCD touch panel.  

The rotary encoders are NOT cheap.  It uses 1 of the HRPG-ASCA-54F 54 PPR encoders, and 4 Elma E37 dual shaft
encoders.  Each of these is on the order of $30.  Ordering information is in fp2_BOM.xls
